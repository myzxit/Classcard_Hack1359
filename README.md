# Classcard Hack 사용법 (한글 안내)

## 소개
이 프로젝트는 Classcard(클래스카드) 웹사이트에서 다양한 학습 유형(암기, 리콜, 스펠, 테스트 등)을 자동화/매크로/API 변조 방식으로 빠르게 학습할 수 있도록 도와주는 도구입니다.

> ⚠️ 본 프로그램은 교육/연구/개인 실험 목적으로만 사용하세요. 실제 수업/평가/공식 학습에 **절대** 악용하지 마세요.

---

## 주요 기능
- 다양한 학습 유형 자동화 (암기, 리콜, 스펠, 매칭, 테스트, 퀴즈배틀 등)
- 여러 세트, 여러 학습 유형을 한 번에 선택하여 순차적으로 학습
- 단어/뜻 자동 추출 및 처리
- API 변조를 통한 빠른 학습 처리(일부 유형)
- 매크로 방식의 실제 자동 클릭/입력 지원

---

## 준비물
- Python 3.8 이상
- Chrome 브라우저
- pip 패키지 설치: selenium, beautifulsoup4, requests 등

### 설치 방법
1. 저장소를 다운로드/클론합니다.
2. `requirements.txt`로 필요한 패키지를 설치합니다.
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## 실행 방법
1. 터미널(명령 프롬프트)에서 프로젝트 폴더로 이동합니다.
2. 아래 명령어로 실행합니다.
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
3. 로그인 후, 학습할 **클래스**와 **세트**를 선택합니다.
   - 여러 세트는 `1,3,5`처럼 콤마로 구분해 입력
   - 전체는 `all` 입력
4. 학습 유형을 선택합니다.
   - 여러 유형을 `8,9,5`처럼 콤마로 구분해 입력 (입력한 순서대로 실행)
   - 예: `8,9,5` → 리콜, 스펠, 테스트 순서로 실행
5. 이후 안내에 따라 자동으로 학습이 진행됩니다.

## 주의사항 및 팁
- **능률보카 단어장** 기준으로 테스트되었습니다. 다른 단어장은 정상 동작을 보장하지 않습니다.
- 리콜, 스펠, 테스트 학습의 매크로 방식만 정상작동을 보장합니다. 다른 학습 방법들은 테스트되지 않았습니다.
- 가끔 중간에 몇 개씩 틀릴 수 있습니다. (프로그램/사이트 구조 변경, 버그그 등)
- 로그인은 수동으로 직접 하셔야 하며, 로그인 후 프로그램 실행 창에 엔터를 눌러야 진행됩니다.
- ChromeDriver 버전이 크롬과 맞지 않으면 실행이 안 될 수 있습니다.
- 프로그램 사용 중 오류가 발생하면 터미널 메시지를 참고하세요.
- 리콜 학습시 학습이 완료되었을때 카드 선택에 문제가 발생했다는 오류 메세지가 보일 수 있습니다. 이는 실제 오류가 아니고 버그이니 무시해주세요.
- 만약 실행이 제대로 안된다면 크롬드라이버 버전 문제일 수 있습니다. 직접 해결하세요.
- **본 프로그램은 공식 Classcard와 무관하며, 모든 책임은 사용자에게 있습니다.**

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the

      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,

      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
